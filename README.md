**Core advantage**


The core advantage of this development board stems from the RK3576 chip it is equipped with.  This chip adopts an eight-core 64-bit design, integrating 4 Cortex-A72 cores and 4 Cortex-A53 cores.  Its powerful processing capability can easily handle complex computing tasks.  Meanwhile, it is equipped with an NPU with a built-in computing power of 6 TOPS, which can efficiently support the operation of artificial intelligence algorithms and endow the development board with outstanding AI processing capabilities.  In addition, the development board supports multiple operating systems such as Android 14 and Debian 12, significantly enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of development.

In terms of interface configuration, the development board is equipped with a rich variety of interfaces. The network port can provide a stable network connection, meeting the requirements for the development board to access the network for data interaction and remote control. The mipi csi 4lane interface can be connected to the camera, facilitating related developments such as image acquisition. The USB3.0 interface supports high-speed data transmission, facilitating the connection of external storage devices and other peripherals. The Tape-C interface has diverse functions, including data transmission and ADB debugging, etc. These interfaces expand the application scenarios of the development board and enable it to adapt to a variety of external devices.

In terms of module functionality, EMMC is responsible for the persistent storage of data and can reliably save the operating system, application programs and user data.  LPDDR4 provides a cache for CPU data processing, enhancing the speed and efficiency of data processing.  The wifi-bt-module supports wireless connection, enabling the development board to achieve wireless Internet access and wireless communication between devices, and enhancing its convenience of use in wireless scenarios.  All modules work in coordination to ensure the stable operation and functional realization of the development board, highlighting the advantages of the high-performance development platform.

(2) Method 2: Use DEBUG or ADB to open the terminal and enter the command `reboot loader` to enter the download mode

****Step 3: Burn****

******Windows flashing******

(1) Open the RKDevTool software on the computer. If the bottom of the software shows "A LOADER device found", it indicates that the board has entered the download mode and subsequent burning operations can be carried out.

******Linux flashing******

Use the command: 
```bash 
sudo./upgrade_tool uf update.img
```

Among them, `update.img` is the system image to be burned
